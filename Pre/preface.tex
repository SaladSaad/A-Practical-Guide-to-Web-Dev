 \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\large Preface}
  This document is broken down into several chapters for your convenience. Furthermore, each chapter or section might have certain pointers to help you distinguish their importance for your career path. FE, BE, FS refer to front-end, back-end, and full stack, respectively. 
    
    An italicized \emph{FE/BE/FS} refers to a recommended but optional skill for those paths. For example, "JavaScript - FE, \emph{BE, FS}" means that as a Front-end developer, you should definitely focus on JS. As a Back-end or Full Stack Dev, you might not need to focus on it as much. This holds for any other italicized text.
